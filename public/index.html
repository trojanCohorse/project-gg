      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<!-- Ahh finally, alone again.. -->
<!-- React, Angular, Vue, Svelt.... Long ago the code-avatar.. master of all 4 frameworks protected the lands from CORS errors but,
 when the world needed the code-avatar most, they dissappeared. 100 years later the world is dominated by CORS errors and many believe hope is lost. 
but, I still believe the code-avatar will return and when they do, they will save the world... -->



<!-- Book 1: React -->
<!-- Episode 1: A new beginning -->
<!-- My name is Asif and I'm a react developer travelling the world in order to find the code-avatar. I started this journey at the age of
 of 12 and after a long decade of dissapointment I almost gave up on finding the avatar.

Just when I thought all hope was lost I found an abandoned igloo and inside... I found the code-avatar suspended in an infinite loop.
I think this is the start of an amazing journey.
